"""Event Delay Test.

Usage:
# in a new terminal
python test_event_delay.py

Tests the average number of images captured for each delay value [0,MAX_DELAY].
Inherits camera settings form the camera_config file in the directory. Captures
images for NUM_TRIALS for each delay value between [0, MAX_DELAY]. Takes the 
average of all NUM_TRIALS for each delay value and prints it out.
