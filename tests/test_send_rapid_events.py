"""Rapid Events Test.

Author: Imran Matin
Email: imatin@ucsd.edu

Usage:
# in a new terminal
python cSBC.py
# in a new terminal
python test_send_rapid_events.py

Tests the functionality of the cSBC when it is processing an event, and 
another event is triggered and sent to it. Functions as the mSBC. Note, change
the HOST variable to be the IP of the cSBC if you are not running it on the 
localhost. Set the number of events to be sent back to back and how many times
to send them.
